# Transformer Model Implementation

This repository contains a foundational implementation of a transformer model from scratch, using PyTorch. The transformer model is widely used in NLP and sequence-to-sequence tasks, and this project provides an understanding of its essential components, including multi-head self-attention, positional encodings, and encoder-decoder layers.

## Project Structure

- **transformers.py** - Contains the core components of the transformer model, including:
  - Multi-Head Attention Mechanism
  - Positional Encoding
  - Encoder and Decoder Layers
- **Transformers.ipynb** - Script for training the transformer model on sample data.
- **a2_helper.py** - Helper functions for data processing and evaluation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/manisha-goyal/transformer-model-implementation.git
    cd transformer-model-implementation
    ```

## Usage

Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab and execute the cells to train and evaluate the transformer model.

## Key Components

- **Multi-Head Attention**: Implements scaled dot-product attention with multiple heads, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the sequence.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds position information to the input embeddings.
- **Encoder & Decoder Layers**: Stacks of attention and feed-forward layers for encoding the input and decoding the output.
